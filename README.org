* What's this?

This is an attempt at creating an installer for [[https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2][Apache Jena Fuseki]] that will install Jena Fuseki as a windows service.

This git repository contains an [[https://maven.apache.org][Apache Maven]] POM file, that uses the [[https://github.com/alexkasko/windows-service-installer][maven-windows-service-installer-plugin]] to create the installer.

** Creating an installer
To build the installer, the following software is required:
 1. A Java Development Kit
 2. Apache maven
 3. git

The steps to build the installer , is:
 1. Check out the repository
    : git checkout https://github.com/steinarb/fusekiservice.git
 2. Build the repository with maven
    : cd fusekiservice
    : mvn clean install
 3. Build the installer
    : mvn windows-service-installer:installer

** Using the installer to install the windows service
To use the installer:
 1. copy the target/fusekiservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-installer.zip file to the computer the service should be installed on
 2. Unpack the fusekiservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-installer.zip file
 3. Open the fusekiservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-installer directory in Windows Explorer
 4. Right-click the install.exe file and select "Run as administrator"
 5. In the dialog "User Account Control"
    1. Click the button "Yes"
 6. In the "Installation of FusekiService" dialog:
    1. Click the button "Next>"
    2. Click the button "Next>"
    3. In the dialog "Message"
       1. Click on the button "OK"
    4. Click the button "Next>"
    5. Click the button "Next>"
    6. Click the button "Done"

A Jena Fuseki windows service will be installed, the service will be started and starts listening on port 4000.

** Uninstalling the windows service

To remove the installed service:
 1. Open a windows explorer on:
    : %USERPROFILE%\fusekiservice\uninstall
 2. Right-click the "uninstall.exe" file and select "Run as administrator"
 3. In the dialog "User Account Control"
    1. Click the button "Yes"
 4. In the "IzPack - Uninstaller" dialog:
    1. Checkmark the checkbox "Force the deletion of..."
    2. Click the button "Uninstall"
    3. Click the button "Quit"

After the uninstaller has completed, most of the installation directory will be gone (the exception is the top level directory, and the directories "jre", "logs" and "uninstall").
